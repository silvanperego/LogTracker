				&logtracker; automatically continues to monitor all configured log files: Whenever new data is appended, that new data is read
				and sent through the processing pipeline. As a consequence, many tables and graphs are updated automatically as soon as new
				data becomes available.

		<varlistentry><term>Interpret</term>
			<listitem><para>The content of the log lines is interpreted according to the log parser configuration. Interesting text blocks, such
			as timestamps, users, severity levels, service names, response times, correlation ids, etc. are extracted, converted and stored in
			&logtracker;s memory.</para></listitem>

		<varlistentry><term>Combine</term>
			<listitem><para>If more than one file is monitored within one data line, the data from the two sources are combined and ordered
				by the occurrence time. The <emphasis>combine</emphasis>-Element may produce some delay, because it tries to make sure
				that data is delivered in the right order.

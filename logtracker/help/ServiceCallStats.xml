<sect1 id="call_stats"><title>Working with Service Call Statistics</title>
	<para>Service call Statistics typically deals with questions such as:
	</para>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>What was/is the total load on our system?</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>What services were called when, how often, by whom?</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>What was the performance of the system, i.e. the response time to these services?</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Have the been errors while processing the service calls? How many? When?</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	<para>The <emphasis>Service Call Statistics</emphasis> flavor is ideally suited for answering those questions. It can 
		be initiated by
	</para>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>choosing appropriate log files in the <emphasis>Log File Selection Dialog</emphasis>
		(see <xref linkend="confLogSources"/>)</para>. Such log files typically contain one or more log lines
		per service call, which contain a time stamp, the name of the service, the response time, and optionally
		the user who invoked the service and a return code.

	<sect2><title>The service call statistics panel</title>
		<para>A <emphasis>service statistics panel</emphasis> will appear. An example is schon in <xref linkend="servStatPanel"/>.
			The panel lists all the services that have been called together with some important statistical numbers. All these
			numbers consider the full observation time period of all monitored log files. 
			They are:
		</para>
		<variablelist>
			<varlistentry><term>Calls</term>
				<listitem><para>Shows how many times a specific service was called in total.</para></listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry><term>Errors</term>
				<listitem><para>Show the number of service calls of a specific service that returned with an error code.
					<footnote><para>This column is only displayed if the active log parser configuration contains a
						<emphasis>Value representing "OK"</emphasis>. See <xref linkend="captGroupConfParam"/>.
					</para></footnote>
				</para></listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry><term>Calls per Minute</term>
				<listitem><para>The number of service calls, divided by the observation period, i.e. the mean number of
					service calls per minute.
				</para></listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry><term>Mean Response Time</term>
				<listitem><para>The mean response times. Calculated as the sum of all response times divided by the
					number of service calls.
				</para></listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry><term>Median</term>
				<listitem><para>The median of the response times. Half of the observed service call took longer, half of them
					took shorter to respond than this value. The median is less sensitive to extreme values than the mean response time:
					A few service calls with very long response times can lead to elevated mean response times, but have less influence
					onto the median.
				</para></listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry><term>90% percentile</term>
				<listitem><para>The 90% percentile of the response times. 10% of all service calls took shorter than this value to respond.
				</para></listitem>
			</varlistentry>
		</variablelist>
		<para>The row named "total" considers all service calls. The rows that are labeled with a service name represent 
			the statistics of a specific service.</para>

		<para>A user can interact with the <emphasis>service call statistics panel</emphasis> in various ways. By clicking a row in the service
			table, he can bring up a <emphasis>Service Call Detail</emphasis> window will pop up and show the individual service calls.
			One by row. See <xref linkend="servDetailPanel"/>.

		</figure>
		<para>The right half of the service statistics table is used for the configuration of a service scatter plot: The checkboxes define
			what details will be shown in the plot. The meanings of the checkboxes are:
		</para>
		<variablelist>
			<varlistentry><term>Scatter</term>
				<listitem><para>When enabled, every service single service call of a specific service is represented by a dot.</para></listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry><term>perSecond</term>
				<listitem><para>When enabled, a line which represents the number of service calls per second is displayed. This average
					value will be calculated once per minute.
				</para></listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry><term>Mean</term>
				<listitem><para>When enabled, a line representing the mean response times (per minute) is displayed.</para></listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry><term>Median</term>
				<listitem><para>When enabled, a line representing the median response times (evaluated once per minute) is displayed.</para></listitem>
			</varlistentry>
		</variablelist>
		<para>The color column allows the assignment of specific colors to specific services. When clicked, a color chooser dialog is brought up.
			The <emphasis>Statistics Magnification Factors</emphasis> allows an artificial steepening of the "Mean" and "Median" lines by multiplying
			the according values with a factor. This can be useful, when those lines are hard to see behind the dots of the scatter plots.
